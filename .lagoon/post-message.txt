We've lagoonized your project `laravel10`

What you might want to do now is examine the .lagoon.yml file to check the default post-rollout tasks.
These are standard tasks that are run when your site will be deployed to Lagoon.
We've included some Laravel cache clearning and running of migrations.

Enjoy Lagooning!!!
